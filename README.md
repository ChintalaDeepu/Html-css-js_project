Html Code Explanation
* This HTML code creates a simple **Speech Text Reader** interface using the SpeechSynthesis API. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares HTML5, and the `<html lang="en">` element wraps the whole page, with the `<head>` section containing metadata like character encoding (`UTF-8`), viewport settings for mobile responsiveness, links to external resources such as Font Awesome for icons, and `style.css` for styling, along with a `<title>` for the browser tab. Inside the `<body>`, a main container displays the page title and a toggle button to show or hide the text input box. The text box (`<div id="text-box">`) contains a close button with a Font Awesome “X” icon, a voice selection dropdown, a textarea for entering text, and a “Read Text” button to trigger speech synthesis. An empty `<main>` tag is included for possible future content. At the end, a `<script>` tag links to `script.js`, which will handle the logic for showing/hiding the text box, populating the voices list, and reading the entered text aloud.

JS Code Explanation
* This JavaScript code powers the **Speech Text Reader** by creating interactive speech boxes, loading available voices, and speaking text aloud using the **Web Speech API**. It starts by selecting key DOM elements — the main display area, dropdown for voices, text input, buttons for reading text, toggling, and closing the text box. A `data` array holds objects with `image` filenames and corresponding `text` messages. The `createBox()` function generates a clickable visual box for each item, displaying an image and message, and attaches a click handler that triggers speech output via `handleSpeech()`. This function sets the speech message, speaks it, and briefly adds an "active" visual effect. The `getVoices()` function retrieves available voices from `speechSynthesis`, populating the dropdown. A global `message` object (`SpeechSynthesisUtterance`) stores the current text and voice. `setTextMessage()` updates the message’s text, `speakText()` speaks it, and `setVoice()` changes the selected voice. Event listeners manage showing/hiding the text box, reacting to voice changes, and reading custom text from the textarea. Finally, `getVoices()` is called at startup, and `voiceschanged` ensures voices load when available.

Style CSS Explanation
* This CSS file styles the **Speech Text Reader** interface, making it responsive, modern, and visually appealing. It begins with an `@import` statement to load the **Open Sans Condensed** font from Google Fonts. CSS variables are defined in `:root` for the main, secondary, light, border, and overlay colors, as well as a common border radius. A universal `*` selector applies `box-sizing: border-box` for consistent sizing. The `body` uses the light background color, the imported font, no margin, and ensures the page takes up the full viewport height. Headings (`h1`) are centered with the secondary color. The `.btn` class defines button styles—main color background, light text, rounded corners, bold font, padding, hover opacity effect, and active click scale-down. `.btn-toggle` centers and spaces the toggle button. The `.text-box` is styled as a centered, hidden modal with a dark background, white text, padding, rounded corners, and a slide-in animation when `.show` is applied. Inside `.text-box`, `select` and `textarea` elements are styled with matching colors, padding, rounded corners, and full width; the close icon floats right and is clickable. The `main` container uses a **CSS grid layout** that starts with one column and adjusts at breakpoints (2 columns at 576px, 3 at 768px, 4 at 1200px). `.box` elements display as clickable cards with shadows, rounded corners, an image, and a colored text label. When `.active`, the box gets a glowing shadow in the main color. Images are set to a fixed height and cropped with `object-fit: cover`, while `.info` text is centered, uppercase, and spaced evenly. This design ensures both desktop and mobile devices have a clean, responsive, and interactive layout.
